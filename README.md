## Description
In React, mapping components refers to using the .map() function to iterate over an array of data and return a corresponding React component for each item in the array. This allows dynamic rendering of multiple components based on the array content, making it an efficient way to generate lists or repetitive elements in the UI. Each mapped component should have a unique key prop to help React optimize re-rendering.
